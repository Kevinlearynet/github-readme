Easily embed GitHub READMEs in Pages/Posts.

== Description ==

Github README is a plugin that allows you to embed a GitHub README in a page or post using a simple shortcode. 

Usage:

[github_readme repo="octalmage/Marknote"]

You can also trim lines from the top of the readme using the "trim" option: 

[github_readme repo="octalmage/Marknote" trim="3"]

This is useful for removing titles since your page/post will most likely already have one.
